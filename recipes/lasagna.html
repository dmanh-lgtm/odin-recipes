    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3><strong>Lasagna</strong> is a classic Italian oven-baked dish</h3>
    <p>1. <strong>The Traditional Italian (Bolognese) Method</strong>
        This version focuses on rich, slow-cooked flavors and uses a creamy white sauce instead of ricotta.
        The Sauce (Ragù): A hearty meat sauce made by sautéing a soffritto (onion, carrot, and celery) with ground beef
        and pork. It is simmered with tomatoes and often a splash of red wine for several hours to deepen the flavor.
        The Cream (Béchamel): A smooth, white sauce made from a roux of butter and flour whisked with milk and a pinch
        of nutmeg.
        The Assembly: Thin sheets of egg pasta are layered with the meat ragù, the creamy béchamel, and a generous
        dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It is baked until the top is golden and bubbling.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. The Classic American (Ricotta) Method</strong>
        This popular version is known for its gooey, cheesy texture and the use of ricotta cheese as a central layer.
        The Meat Layer: A savory mixture of ground beef and often Italian sausage, seasoned with garlic, basil, and
        oregano in a thick tomato-based marinara sauce.
        The Cheese Filling: A blend of ricotta cheese, beaten egg (to act as a binder), Parmesan, and fresh parsley.
        The Assembly: Wide, rippled lasagna noodles are layered with the meat sauce, the ricotta mixture, and a heavy
        topping of shredded mozzarella cheese. It is baked covered with foil to keep it moist, then uncovered at the end
        to brown the cheese.
