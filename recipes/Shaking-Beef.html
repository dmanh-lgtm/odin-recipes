    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shaking Beef is a popular Vietnamese-French inspired dish featuring tender cubes of sear-roasted beef sautéed with garlic, soy sauce, and butter. The name "Shaking Beef" comes from the constant "shaking" or tossing of the wok to sear the meat evenly.</p>
    <p>It is traditionally served on a bed of fresh watercress and sliced tomatoes, with a side of lime-salt-pepper dipping sauce for a perfect balance of savory and tangy flavors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Protein: 500g beef tenderloin or ribeye, cut into 1-inch cubes.</li>
        <li>Marinade: Soy sauce, oyster sauce, minced garlic, and a touch of sugar.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Red onions, bell peppers, watercress, and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cooking Fat: Vegetable oil and a knob of unsalted butter for richness.</li>
        <li>Dipping Sauce: Fresh lime juice, sea salt, and black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate Beef: Toss the beef cubes with the marinade ingredients and let sit for at least 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare Veggies: Wash the watercress and arrange it on a serving plate with sliced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>High-Heat Sear: Heat oil in a wok until smoking. Add beef in a single layer and let it sear for 1 minute without moving.</li>
        <li>The "Shake": Add onions and peppers, then shake the wok constantly for 2-3 minutes until the beef is medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Finish & Serve: Stir in a bit of butter for a glossy finish, then pour the beef over the bed of watercress. Enjoy hot!</li>
    </ol>
